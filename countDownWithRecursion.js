/**
 * We have defined a function called countdown with one parameter (n).
 * The function should use recursion to return an array containing the integers n through 1 based on the n parameter.
 * If the function is called with a number less than 1, the function should return an empty array.
 * For example, calling this function with n = 5 should return the array [5, 4, 3, 2, 1].
 * Your function must use recursion by calling itself and must not use loops of any kind.
